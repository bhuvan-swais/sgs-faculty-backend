"""
Assignment service — list, create, and who each assignment went to.

An assignment row in sgs_assignment_master says which *class* it belongs to.
Which *students* actually received it lives in sgs_assignment_results: one row
per target, written at creation with status "assigned" and filled in as they
submit. Every assignment gets those rows — a class-wide one simply targets the
whole roll — so consumers (student and parent dashboards) can read a student's
assignments by joining results on student_id rather than guessing from class_id.
